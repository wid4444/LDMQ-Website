        <p className='my-2 text-xl font-bold text-stone-500 dark:text-emerald-50'>Hi there! I'm Leobardo, although most folks know me as Danny.</p>
        <p className='my-2 text-xl font-bold text-stone-500 dark:text-emerald-50'>Back in 2022, I made the exciting decision to dive into the world of coding and web development through Tech Elevator. Since then, I've had the incredible opportunity to craft software solutions for diverse clients, including non-profits, artists, and small corporation.</p>
        <p className='my-2 text-xl font-bold text-stone-500 dark:text-emerald-50'>These days, my primary focus revolves around creating user-friendly interfaces for our valued customers at Tech Impact. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of design and engineering, where I strive to build software that not only looks good but also performs seamlessly behind the scenes.</p>
        <p className='my-2 text-xl font-bold text-stone-500 dark:text-emerald-50'>When I'm not in my computer, you'll often find me in my woodworking workshop, enjoying quality time with my wife and our furry companion Lilly, tackling various projects around the house, or watching anime.</p>
        {/* <p className='my-2 text-base font-normal text-stone-500 dark:text-emerald-50'>With my attention to detail, creativity, and communication I like to create responsive, and user-friendly application ideas. I am always interested in learning new languages and frameworks, improving my skills, and making contributions to society.</p> */}
